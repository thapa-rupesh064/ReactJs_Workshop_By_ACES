## Hooks

- prebuilt function of react/ .jsx
- Always starts with use
- E.g. useState, useEffect, useRef......

### useState

useState lets a functional component store and update data (state) that changes over time, and automatically re-renders the UI when that data changes.

Without `useState`, a functional component is just a static piece of HTML—it won’t change after rendering.

- useState(0) returns an array of a var and a function to change the value of var
